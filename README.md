If you want to setup VS Code to have the same configuration as in the screenshot above, follow this 8 minutes tutorial link [takeUforward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3uDCJ5mvgw&t=6s)



Depending of your OS, you can use a shortcut to run the code. For me, as a MacOS user, I insert a test case in `input.txt` file, run the algoritm code with `Cmd+Shift+B` and the expected output is displayed in `output.txt`.



Give it a try and have fun!
